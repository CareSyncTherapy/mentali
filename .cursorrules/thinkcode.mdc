# Core Development Rules

## Code Quality Standards
- **79 character line limit** - Never exceed 79 characters per line
- **2 blank lines** between functions and classes
- **No hardcoded strings** - Always use dynamic variables
- **Binary operators at line start** - When breaking lines, put operators at the beginning of the next line

## Error Handling
- Use `log_to_db` function instead of `logging.error`
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Handle exceptions gracefully with specific exception types

## Code Review Process
- **Pro perspective**: Advocate for the code's strengths and benefits
- **Con perspective**: Identify potential issues, risks, and alternatives  
- **Neutral perspective**: Synthesize both viewpoints and make balanced recommendations

## Refactoring Safety
- **ALWAYS** review the entire repository before deleting functions/files
- Ensure all references to changed code are updated or removed
- Verify no broken dependencies remain

## Dynamic Programming
- Prefer dynamic solutions over static strings
- Use variables and configuration over hardcoded values
- Keep code flexible and maintainable
